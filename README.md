#How Does Bio Length Affect the Likes Received on Dating Apps?\

##Summary / Introduction

There is an investigation of the interaction between words in a user's bio and likes on dating apps based on a sample of 50,000 dating app users' profiles. We tested whether the words in their bio impact how many likes users acquire, with age as a control variable for users. In our statistical testing, regression modeling, ANOVA, F-tests, and t-tests were applied with no significant interaction between words in the bio and acquired likes found repeatedly (p = 0.973, R² ≈ 0). Scatter plot visual inspection reinforced no apparent interaction between variables. The result is in disagreement with common dating advice based on profile optimization. While the length of the bio does not work as an indicator, our broad prediction intervals (±113.7 likes) indicate high variability due to unmeasured variables such as picture maximization, interests compatibility, or algorithm rules. This research suggests the difficulty in dating app success factors and advises testing additional variables in future studies.


##Body of Report

###1. Quantative Summary of Data

Our sample consists of 50,000 users of dating applications whose profiles include details on the length of bio (X) and the received likes (Y). The bio length averages 250 words with a standard deviation of 144 words, varying between 0 and 500 words. This reveals high heterogeneity in the amount authored within profiles, as some users leave their bios blank but others take up the maximum space their platform allows. For the dependent measure, received likes, the typical member in our sample received close to 99.5 likes, while specific standard deviation scores reveal high variability in popularity among profiles.

###2. Scatter Diagram Analysis

A scatter plot between the bio length and received likes displays no apparent relationship or pattern between the two variables. Points are randomly spread out on the graph with no apparent positive or negative slope. This graphical representation is the initial suggestion that perhaps the length of the bio is not an important variable in whether or not the profile will receive likes. That the data points are randomly spread out is an indication that those users who have very little content in their bio can get as much in terms of likes as those who have long profile descriptions.

###3. Control Variable Introduction

We controlled for age in our analysis since it could potentially affect how people construct their bios as well as how others see them on this platform. Age can play an important role in terms of influencing user activity, matching interests, as well as overall experience in the dating app. According to our descriptive statistics, older users are variable in both their bio lengths as well as their like metrics, and this could imply that age can affect desirability perceptions, the availability of matches, as well as communication tactics in the dating environment.
###4. Regression Model and ANOVA Analysis
Our regression equation from our analysis is: ŷ = 99.54093 - 0.00006(X), where X is in words for bio length and ŷ is the predicted value for likes. SSR is 167,999,996.288, SSE is 3.712299, and SST is 168,000,000. Because the very low R² value (R² = 2.21e-8) tells us that bio length accounts for essentially zero of the variance in likes received, this incredibly poor goodness of fit implies that unobserved variables account for the variability in profile popularity.

###5. T-Test for Significant Relationship

We tested at a significance level of α = 0.05 whether there is any significant association between bio length and likes received. We posited that the null hypothesis (H₀) is that there is no effect of bio length on likes received (β₁ = 0), and our alternative hypothesis (H₁) is that there is an effect (β₁ ≠ 0). We computed the t-statistic for the slope parameter as -0.03322 with p-value = 0.973498. Because this p-value is above our chosen level of significance of 0.05, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This assists in affirming that there is no statistically significant association between bio length and likes received in our sample.

###6. F-Test for Significance

We carried out an F-test to assess the overall fit of our regression model. We had an F-value of 0.001104 with a p-value of 0.973498. Because this p-value is above our significance level of 0.05, we are not able to reject the null hypothesis. This agrees with our findings on the t-test and again supports the fact that bio length does not account for any significant variance in the number of dating profile likes.

###7. Predicted Value for Yp

As an example of our model's ability to predict, we computed the predicted number of likes for a profile that is 150 words in length:
 "yₚ = 99.54093 + (-0.00006 × 150) = 99.53"
With this, it is clear that according to our model, a user having a 150-word bio would be predicted to get about 99.53 likes. Unfortunately, on account of our model having very poor explanatory power, this prediction is quite suspect.

###8. Confidence Interval and Prediction Interval

For the profile with a bio length of 150 words, the 95%-confidence interval for the response E(yₚ) is [99.02, 100.04]. This tight range indicates that it is plausible that we are fairly certain of an average number of likes for profiles with 150-word bios. In contrast, the 95%-prediction interval for any particular profile (yₚ) is considerably wider at [-14.17, 213.23]. This broad range is indicative of the great variability in the amount of received like that is not accounted for based on bio length, supporting the hypothesis that other variables are more heavily influencing dating app success.


##Conclusion

Our findings unequivocally prove that bio length does not have any statistically significant correlation with the number of likes on dating app profiles. Irrespective of how often advice is shared on how to optimize dating profiles, the length of your bio does not affect the popularity of your profile at all, as can be seen in our near zero R² value and high p-values for both t and F tests.
